August 3rd 2022:
	- Moved include/lowlevel.c to include/lowlevel/lowlevel.c
	- Moved include/houric.c to include/houric/*.c
	- Kernel binary filename changed to houri from hourios
	- Updated Makefile:
		+ Now the recipe for building ISO is `iso-grub`
		+ Recipe for building kernel binary changed to `houri`
		+ More comments in the file to aid you if you want
			customizaion.
		+ Recipe `backup` creates "hourios-src-archive" now
			instead of kernel.tar. The compression method
			can now be easily changed by modifying PKG.
		+ Added new recipe `bintar`: creates "hourios-bin-archive".
			Makes an archive of binary and ISO files instead of
			the whole directory. Compression method can also
			be changed similar to `backup`
		+ `clean` is splitted up:
			clean-bin removes ISO and binary files
			clean-libs removes compiled .so files
			clean-obj removes .o files
		+ New recipe `libs`: Links include/houric/*.o to 
			lib/libhouric.so, links include/lowlevel/lowlevel.o
			to lib/liblowlevel.so

August 5th 2022:
	- Added ROSD (Red Screen of Death) Fatal Event Handler.
		+ ROSD will be called at last, after kernel exits.
	- Added 2 new functions to hourilib: rand() and srand().
		+ These 2 will function similar to C rand() and srand().
