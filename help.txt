I'm Hourin, again.

Shift modify *partially* works now. You can try that out in build/hourios.iso
Press a few keys, then press those keys while holding Shift.

As you can see, the keys change to uppercase.

However, there's a problem:
	If you, for example, use isShift() in somewhere, like SSatori, you may notice
   that the Shift flag doesn't reset. I don't know if this is a isShift() fault, or my fault
   when printing. I was so exicited I totally forgor how did I write the codes.

Anyhow, here's my request:
	- Investigate the problem mentioned above.
	- Implement the rest of printable keys in include/system/keyboard.h (macros) and
   include/system/keyboard.c (keycodeToASCII(), converting). I only plan on implementing the
   main part of the keyboard, and I have implemented the alphabet characters. Your job is only to
   #define the F1 to F12 keys, 1 to 0, Control, Super, and Meta key. HouriOS uses scancode table 1.
   You don't have to #define the release scancodes. I have found out that release=press+0x80.
   	- Implement the number keys in keycodeToASCII(), and their Shift alternatives in keypacketToASCII().
	- If possible, also implement the release and press checks for other modifier keys (isShift(), isCtrl(),
	isMeta(), isSuper()).
	- I'm pretty confident that you will be able to complete those even without testing. All keyboard related 
   things have been well documented: the bits order, example for flipping and checking a bit.
